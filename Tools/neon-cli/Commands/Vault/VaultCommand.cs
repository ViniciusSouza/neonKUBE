Manages encrypted files.

USAGE:

    neon vault
    neon vault create PATH [PASSWORD-NAME]
    neon vault decrypt SOURCE TARGET
    neon vault edit PATH
    neon vault encrypt PATH [--password=PASSWORD-NAME]
    neon vault encrypt SOURCE TARGET [PASSWORD-NAME]
    neon vault password-name PATH

REMARKS:

[neon] file encryption uses AES 256-bit encryption to secure files on disk
such that they may be persisted to source control repositories and other
locations that may not be very secure.  This is a nice way to distribute
sensitive files to developers, operators, and CI/CD build environments.

This works by referencing named passwords stored in a secure location.
These passwords are stored in the current user folder at:

    %USERPROFILE%\.neonkube\passwords   - on Windows
    $HOME/.neonkube/passwords           - on OS/X and Linux

These files are encrypted at rest when possible (e.g. for Windows 10/PRO+).
In the future, we may support two-factor authentication devices such as
YubiKey to harden this even more.

Each password file holds the password itself and the password file name
is used as the name to identify each password.  The file commands use
password names to explicitly or implictly identify the password to be
used to manage specific files.  For example:

    neon vault create foo.txt default

creates an encrypted file named [foo.txt] using the password named [default].
The [default] password must already exist in the current user's passwords
folder.  Passwords can be managed via:

    neon password export [PASSWORD-NAMES...] ZIPFILE
    neon password import ZIPFILE
    neon password rm PASSWORD-NAME
    neon set PASSWORD-NAME [PASSWORD]

where the [set/rm] commands provide for creating and deleting passwords and
the [export/import] commands provide a way to share passwords using encrypted
ZIP files.

A password name must be specified when creating or encrypting a file.  This
may be done by explicitly passing the password name on the command line
or implicitly by creating a [.password-name] file in the same directory as
the target file or in one of its ancestor directories.

[neon] will search the current and ancestor directores up to the file 
system root for the first [.password-name] file when no password name is 
explicitly specified.  The [.password-name] file simply holds the name 
of the password.  This is a convenient way to specified default passwords
for a project.

Vault commands like [create] and [edit] will decrypt and launch a text
editor so that the file can be edited.  The default platform editor will
be launched (NotePad.exe for Windows or Vim for OS/X and Linux).  You can
customize the editor by setting the EDITOR environment variable to the path
to the editor executable file.
