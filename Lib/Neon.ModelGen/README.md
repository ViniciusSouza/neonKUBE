Neon.ModelGen
=============

Supports noSQL style development by generating classes and HTTP service clients that support data round-tripping without data loss for JSON.  You can get started here: [Neon.ModelGen](https://doc.neonkube.com/N_Neon_ModelGen.htm)

Note that this is still a work in progress.  This can generate models but we don't actually support forward compatibility yet.
