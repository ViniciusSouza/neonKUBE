    /// <para>
    /// Basing your service implementations on the <see cref="Service"/> class will
    /// make them easier to test via integration with the <b>ServiceFixture</b> from
    /// the <b>Neon.Xunit</b> library by providing some useful abstractions over

    /// This class is pretty easy to use.  Simply derive your service class from <see cref="NeonService"/>
    /// and implement the <see cref="OnRunAsync"/> method.  <see cref="OnRunAsync"/> will be called when 
    /// your service is started.  This is where you'll implement your service.  You should perform any
    /// initialization and then call <see cref="SetRunningAsync"/> to indicate that the service is ready for
    /// business.
    /// </para>
    /// <note>
    /// Note that calling <see cref="SetRunningAsync()"/> after your service has initialized is important
    /// because the <b>NeonServiceFixture</b> won't allow tests to proceed until the service
    /// indicates that it's ready.  This is necessary to avoid unit test race conditions.
    /// </note>
    /// <para>
    /// Note that your <see cref="OnRunAsync"/> method should generally not return until the 
    /// <see cref="Terminator"/> signals it to stop.  Alternatively, you can throw a <see cref="ProgramExitException"/>
    /// with an optional process exit code to proactively exit your service.
    /// </para>
    /// <note>
    /// All services should properly handle <see cref="Terminator"/> stop signals so services deployed as
    /// containers will stop promptly and cleanly (this also applies to services running in unit tests).  
    /// Your terminate handler method must return within a set period of time (30 seconds by default) 
    /// to avoid killed by by Docker or Kubernetes.  This is probably the trickiest thing you'll need to implement.

    /// </para>
