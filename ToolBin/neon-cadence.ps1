# Maintains the http://github.com/nforgeio/cadence repository by adding
# new Cadence release branches from the source http://github.com/uber/cadence
# repository.
#
# USAGE: powershell -file ./neon-cadence.ps1 PATH BRANCH
#
# COMMANDS:
#
#       sync master         - Synchronizes our cloned MASTER branch with
#                             the original Uber Cadence MASTER and pushes
#                             the changes to our forked branch on GitHub.
#
#       release BRANCH      - Creates a new local copy of the specified 
#                             branch from the original Uber Cadence repository
#                             and pushes the changes to our forked branch
#                             on GitHub.
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
#
# You must have http://github.com/nforgeio/cadence cloned to [%NF_REPOS/neon-cadence].
#
# REMARKS:
#
# The [release] command expects BRANCH to be the name of the source branch from
# the original Uber Cadence repository.  Note that Cadence branches named like
# [0.5.8_release] are still in progress and have not yet been released.
